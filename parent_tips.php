    <div class="information">
    <p>FPB provides advice regarding the age suitability of a game. 
       However, every child is different. Ultimately parents should decide
       what their children are capable of viewing or experiencing. Here are a few tips:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always look for the age classification on the game package or via the search engine on this website.</li>
      <li>Try to look for a summary or review of the game content or ideally play the game yourself first. </li>
      <li>Play video games with your children, watch over them when they play and talk with them about the games they play.
        Explain why certain games are not suitable.</li>
      <li>Be aware that online games sometimes enable the download of extra software that can alter the game content and eventually the age classification of the game.</li>
      <li>Online games are usually played in virtual communities requiring players to interact with unknown fellow players. 
        Tell your children not to give out personal details and report inappropriate behaviour.</li>
      <li>Set the limits by using the parental control tools of the game console or pc.</li>
    </ul>
